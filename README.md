#  Algorithm exercises

**Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers**

Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

start
input n
sum of all natural numbers sum=n*(n+1)/2
return the sum
End
```

**Problem 2: Check for Prime Number**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.
Start
input n
Read the number n
start the loop
if n is divisible by"i" in the loop then break down the loop.
if-else statement to check the given
number is prime or not
end

**Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**

Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.
```
The user should input three values: a, b, and c.
The algorithm should compare the numbers and print the maximum value.
Start
input read three numbers a,b and c.
compare
if-else statement to check the largest number
Output: Display the largest number.
End

**Problem 4: Factorial Calculation**

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.
The user should input a number n.
The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to n.
Start
input a numberv n
initialise a variable all  integeers from 1 to n1
  factorial 1 = factorial * 1
Display the value of factorial
End

**Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.
Start
input a number n
check if n is divisible by 2
if yes, display  "even"
if no, display "odd"
End
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether n is divisible by 2 and display the result as either "Even" or "Odd".
