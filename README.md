#  Algorithm exercises

**Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers**

Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

start
input n
sum of all natural numbers sum=n*(n+1)/2
return the sum
End
```

**Problem 2: Check for Prime Number**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.
Start
input n
Read the number n
start the loop
if n is divisible by"i" in the loop then break down the loop.
if-else statement to check the given
number is prime or not
end

**Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**

Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.
```
Start
 Input three numbers: a, b, c
 If a > b and a > c, then max = a
 Else if b > a and b > c, then max = b
 Else max = c
 Output max
 End


**Problem 4: Factorial Calculation**

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.
The user should input a number n.
The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to n.
Start.
 Read n.
 Initialize counter variable i to 1 and fact to 1.
 if i <= n go to step 5 otherwise goto step 7.
 calculate fact = fact * i.
 increment counter variable i and go to step 4.
 Write fact.
 Stop


**Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.
Start 
Read/input the number.
 if n%2==0 then the number is even.
 else number is odd.
display the output.
 Stop 
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether n is divisible by 2 and display the result as either "Even" or "Odd".
